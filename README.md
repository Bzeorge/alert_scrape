# alert_scrape
The idea is to make a script which will give me a notification when a new alert pop up on safetravel.is website. 
EDIT: The actual version is able to scrape the website and if there are any weather alerts the script will send you an email with these alerts. If there aren´t any alerts the script return a message and won´t send any email.
