# alert_scrape
The idea is to make a script which will give me a notification when a new alert pop up on safetravel.is website.
\nEDIT: The actual version is able to scrape the website and if there are any weather alerts the script will send you an email with these alerts. If there aren´t any alerts the script return a message and won´t send any email.
\nEDIT2: I created some new functions. The first new feature is setting a default email as class variables so you don´t need to write your email over and over. And I also made a function to simply change this mail. The second feature is showing the warning on your command line without sending. The next step would be making a list of emails and in case there will be alerts you want to send, you would simply pres Y / N.
